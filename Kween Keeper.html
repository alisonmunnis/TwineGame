You have just found and captured your very first swarm of bees!

It was difficult to obtain them but you did it.
You have your little bee outfit on and you&#39;re setting them up in their new home.
After hours of slaving over your new cute bee family, you finally close them up in their hutch...

!!SHAZAM!!
*lightning*
!!!!P O O F!!!!!


Why are you so small? What is this weird movement you feel on your back? There&#39;s a strange sensation of weightlessness.

O M BEE

You&#39;re a bee.
But you still have human arms? You look into a reflective surface. 

Yup. Well, will you look at that. 

You still have your human features, but you&#39;re bee-sized and have insect-esque iridescent wings!
You see the hutch, which is now GINORMOUS by the way, where you just put your first group of precious lil bee babies

Do you: 

[[Go inside]] the hutch?
[[Fly around]] and get your bearings?

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Go inside" tags="" position="202,25" size="200,100">You&#39;ve done your research on bees, but you&#39;ve always wondered what it would actually be like inside a hive or even your own man-made bee hutch.
So you decide to fly in and get the full experience. 

You&#39;re not in the hutch two seconds before you come across your first bee. By the looks of him, he&#39;s just your run-of-the-mill worker bee, but when he spots you buzzing towards him he performs the strangest, almost human-like, gesture where it appears he&#39;s putting his fuzzy bee leg up to his mouth as if to shush you.

You pause and stare at him becuase you can&#39;t believe your tiny eyes.

Then, the bee starts talking to you.

&quot;Hey!&quot; he whisper yells, &quot;You gonna just gawk at me or are you gonna help me out?&quot;

You continue to gawk for a second.
Then, you buzz over to him curious as to why he&#39;s sneeking around and what in the world would he need help with.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; you ask him.
&quot;Keep your voice down, will ya?!&quot; he mutters, &quot;I&#39;m trying to get outta here, what else would I be doin&#39;?&quot;
&quot;But you&#39;re a bee.&quot;
&quot;No duh, dummy, and what the heck are you? Freakiest thing I&#39;ve ever seen in my life.&quot;
&quot;I just mean where else can you go? This is where you live, where your family is. Why would you want to leave?&quot;

A loud buzzing sound in the distance suddenly gets much louder. It sounds like a couple of other bees are approaching.

&quot;SHH! Shh. Listen, I want a better life for myself. You think I want to be workin&#39; for my whole short life? No, of course not. I&#39;m gonna go out there, buzz around to all the flowers I want, and answer to no one, got me? NO ONE. If you had any sense, you&#39;d get away too. Now are you gonna *help* me out? Or *rat* me out?&quot;

The group of bees was getting much closer now. They were practically on top of spot in which you and your new aquaintance were hiding.

Now, you were never the type to &quot;rat&quot; others out. As you see it, it&#39;s none of your business. In fact, good for him for wanting more from his short life. Good for him for doing something about it...but what should *you*  do?

&quot;Okay, what can I do to get you out of here?&quot; you whisper to him
&quot;For starters, you can keep quiet, Freaky. The Queen&#39;s guard is closin&#39; in on us,&quot; he responds.
&quot;Are they already after you?&quot;
&quot;Shh! What did I just say? Pipe down. And no, they have more important things to worry about than me, but that don&#39;t exactly mean I want to go advertising what I&#39;m doin&#39;, alright? Now, quiet! They&#39;re coming.&quot;

The Queen&#39;s guard are finallly on top of you and your friend&#39;s hiding spot. You overhear the queen&#39;s gaurd buzzes echo through the hive, frantic.

&quot;-understand. How can this have happened?? Are you absoloutely certain she&#39;s not there?&quot;

&quot;Positive. The Queen would never skip her morning cup of Honeypot&#39;s Special Sweet Pollen Coffee. It&#39;s her life blood. Her Majesty is definitely lost.&quot;

Oh wow! The queen of the swarm is gone?! A whole forest that was probably chock full of bees, and you pick the one swarm that doesn&#39;t have a queen? 

Oh wait a second.

Could YOU be the cause of this?

Could it be that when you captured the swarm the queen was somehow left behind?

&quot;Have it your way, then. Just keep a low profile and don&#39;t say nuttin&#39;,&quot; he whispers back.

You sneak away quick, before the guards&#39; buzzing gets any closer, deliberately go in the opposite direction from their loud approach, and you focus on exploring the hive.

You go through passage after passage of the labrynthian hive, uncertain if you&#39;ll be able to remember all the turns you&#39;ve taken or if you&#39;ll ever find your way out again.

Finally, you come across a dead end. You backtrack to the last turn you took. There are three tunnels, but you know you came through the middle one. You want to keep exploring the hive so you can either go [[left]] or [[right]].

The other bees buzz their agreement.
You&#39;ve gained the respect of the entire bee guard, so it seems.

Now that you&#39;re free from them and have their respect, are you going to take advantage of this by buzzing away?
Maybe you should visit the hive? Pay your respects and find out more about the swarm you smuggled from the forest. Plus, you might even find out how you came to be this size in the first place?

&quot;The queen&#39;s gone! The queen&#39;s gone!&quot; they repeat frantically.

Your captor&#39;s are at a loss. 

&quot;What? How can this bee??&quot; one of them exclaims.

&quot;It was you wasn&#39;t it?!&quot; another suddenly demands, whipping towards you.

&quot;Huh?! NO! I don&#39;t know about anything!&quot; you say desparately, and at this point, you truly feel like you don&#39;t know anything about *anything* anymore. How do you even understand what these bees are saying? How are you even this tiny bee guy? Does this mean you have a stinger? Do you honestly want to know the answer to the last question??


&quot;HEY. Freak! As part of your punishment you will help investigate the queen&#39;s disappearance. should you refuse, you&#39;ll immediately be thrown into the Penitentiar-Bee.&quot; (a bee jail, you can only assume, with a disgusting pun of a name)

&quot;Well, I, uh, have some possible information on the queen and her absence.&quot;

&quot;Oh I bet you do, you freak. You&#39;re probably from another hive trying to sabatoge ours by taking our queen!&quot; one of the guardsbees shouts.

&quot;Now, why would I want to do that?&quot; you ask, taken aback by these accusations, even though it is probably your fault they&#39;re queen-less.

&quot;Taking our queen would make it difficult, impossible even, to sustain life in this hive. We would be forced to evacuate and join your hive, thus aking it stronger, therefore, your queen more powerful! It&#39;s a classic bee move.&quot;

Uh, according to your research that sounds not very bee-like at all, but you weren&#39;t about to say that. In fact, you&#39;re not about to say anything because before you know it, the guard is upon you.

&quot;What? No, of course I didn&#39;t get rid of the queen, are you crazy!? But I&#39;m tellin&#39; ya, I can&#39;t say I&#39;m surprised. A lot of weird things have been going on since The Occurrance.&quot;

&quot;&#39;The Occurance?&#39;&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yesterday there was this bright and loud occurrance. Everything was shaking and everyone was scared outta their exoskeletons. Then all of the sudden....it stopped. Just as suddenly as it started. Now everything&#39;s outta wack, there&#39;s this weird blue sludge everywhere, and there&#39;s been these strange whisperings among the worker bees about one thing and another.

&quot;Does the queen have any enemies? A jealous ex-husband, perhaps?&quot;

&quot;Yes, actually,&quot; one of the guards responds, &quot;He&#39;s in jail becuase he was trying to plan a mutiny.&quot;

Well, that was a lead, if you ever knew one.

The guards lead you the Penitentiar-Bee to a cell that looks to be empty, but it&#39;s too dark to tell.

&quot;This is him.&quot; One of the guards gestures toward the cell, &quot;he insists he likes it dark in there. It&#39;s the only thing that keeps him quiet.&quot;

&quot;Mmn, well for our purposes, I think we&#39;ll need the lights on,&quot; you say trying not to come off as sassy and sarcastic.

The lights come on, but there&#39;s no prisoner!
Just a deep, dark tunnel.

The queen&#39;s gaurd is agast! They think you somehow helped the prisoner escape and that you have a role to play in the mutiny. 

You&#39;re brought on trial before the queen. It&#39;s not a very fair one. You, unfortunately are banished in humiliation from the hive.

Guess you have no choice but to live your life as a bee fairy-man forever.

The guard tosses you into your own little honey-comb cell.
Across the way is another cell that looks empty, but it&#39;s difficult to tell for sure because it&#39;s all dark.
You can hear angry buzzing in the cell to your right. 
It&#39;s quiet in the cell to your left. 
You can hear a strange noise from across the way to your left that almost sounds like an odd buzz-autotuned snoring.
The cell across the way on your right is actually empty.

You&#39;re restless and you have a LOT of questions about your situation.
Hey, you&#39;re an outgoing bee-person hybrid. Why not start up a conversation with one of your neighbors?

You want to talk to the prisoner

[[Directly across from you?? Is there anybody there?]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Directly across from you?? Is there anybody there?" tags="" position="753,702" size="200,100">You call out to the cell. 

There&#39;s no response but the echo of your own voice.
You hear a cough and a murmur from a neighboring cell but you can&#39;t tell which, other than that....

...silence.

It was too quiet in that cell. There&#39;s no way there&#39;s a prisoner in there. A guard happens to be buzzing by so you ask him, &quot;Hey, is there supposed to be a prisoner in there?&quot;

&quot;You should mind your own bees-wax, Freaky One, but yeah there&#39;s a real wild kook in there.&quot;

&quot;Really? How is he so quiet? I mean, even when you sleep, you make *some* noise,&quot; you reason.

&quot;Mmmnn....I&#39;ll bee right back.&quot;

Sure enough, the guard comes back with more guards. They open the cell and shine a light inside. No one&#39;s there. Just a tunnel burrowed out of the darkest corner of the cell. Looks like someone escaped!

The escaped prisoner turns out to be none other than the Queen&#39;s ex-husband who tried to pull a mutiny on her and got himself locked up for it. It appears he escaped in order to overthrow the queen again!

Good thing you said something just in time! The queen&#39;s ex was found not too far from the jail. He had only just made a break for his escape. They executed him on the spot and you are rewarded wonderfully for your contribution.

The queen pardon&#39;s you and even asks if you would like an additional gift.
Which will you take?

Perhaps, this is all a wild dream, a product from all those days and nights researching bees.
Maybe this isn&#39;t a dream at all, but a simulation, including the life you were experiencing before all this madness.


Or maybe it was all due to the fact you picked up this swarm of bees from a forrest that surrounds that rumored nuclear missle testing site, and you had to wade across that pond of questionable electric blue sludge to get to the tree the hive was attatched to, also, not to mention, once you got to the top of that tree, you and the swarm were struck by lightning.

Yeah, you forgot about all that.
You can&#39;t even remember how you and the bees got back to your home.

Huh.

Well, guess it doesn&#39;t matter now! You survived! Now you can live your best life as a hairy fairy, smell flowers every day, live in a house made of legos, and wear the top of an acorn as a hat like you&#39;ve always secretly wanted!

&quot;Your highness, forgive me but, you can&#39;t leave this hive! All your subjects, your *children*, will die!&quot; you exclaim.
&quot;Who are you to tell me what to do?! I can have you thrown out of here and if you say anything against me, I&#39;ll have you accused of treason! If you keep your silence, you will be greatly rewarded. I see the state of you, so I know what you will eventually desire most.&quot;

This statement puzzles you. &quot;What do you mean? With all due respect, how do you know what I&#39;ll &#39;eventually desire?&#39;&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m a queen and I know all that happens in my hive and around it. Also, look at you. You&#39;re obviously not from here, but I do recognize you. But I won&#39;t explain or reward a single thing to an outsider who wrongs me! So what will it be?! Are you going to let me leave? Or will you tell?&quot;

On the one hand, you&#39;ll be letting your hive die by letting her go, but on the other, you&#39;ll get rewarded with some mysterious something that you&#39;ll supposedly desire later.

You find yourself in a strange gathering place for the worker bees. There&#39;s an OVERWHELMING number of them all in one place. They all appear to be eating?
So this must be some kind of Bee Cafeteria.

You spot something odd about the space. There&#39;s electric blue slime oozing from some of the honeycombs on the walls. You can&#39;t help but shudder at the sight of it.

You ask around to some of the workers to see if they know anything about it. They all give similar answers.

Something about &quot;The Occurrance&quot; and how the stuff just sort of appeared afterwards. According to all sources, so far, this &quot;Occurrance&quot; was impossibly bright and incredibly loud.

One of the older bees who looks like he was on his last leg (literally, his other five seem to have been pulled off) herds you to the side.

&quot;You look like someone I know, sonny,&quot; he warbles, &quot;You like you have a question.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I do, actually,&quot; you say kindly. You feel strange being called &quot;sonny&quot; because you&#39;re not exactly the spring chicken you used to be, but you&#39;ll humor this bee.

&quot;What&#39;s this blue goo coming out of the walls?&quot; you ask him.

With his remaining leg, he presents you wiht a cup of the goop. As you begin to reach for it, the bee takes in a deep, rattling breath and *spits* a giant glob of mucus into the slime. 

YUCK.

The old timer thrusts the now putrid-smelling, pulsing pink mixture into your hand. 

&quot;Drink up, sonny,&quot; he says. Then, he dies. Right there on the spot.

You look dubiously into the mixture.

[[You drink, it was his final wish after all]]
[[Ew, there&#39;s no way I&#39;m drinking this. That old coot&#39;s crazy]]

The queen looks at you suspiciously

You leave her quarters all too quickly. You go down several passages, but you can&#39;t help but feel the queen is still watching you. Finally, you run into some worker bees.

&quot;Hey! Hey you guys, don&#39;t panic but I think the queen is trying to leave! She wants to get out of the hive!&quot;

No sooner had you finished that sentence had the queen and several guards appeared out of nowhere.

&quot;You lying, treasonous slimeball! The filth coming out of his mouth is heresay. Absoloute SLANDER!!&quot; the queen shrieks, &quot;I sentence him to an immediate death!&quot;

The queen&#39;s guards bear down on you with their stingers.

And that&#39;s how you die.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="22" name="Keep her secret" tags="" position="102,901" size="200,100">&quot;I won&#39;t say anything, I swear,&quot; you tell the queen.

&quot;Good. I do too much for this hive and it&#39;s far too stressful taking care of all of it. I just need to leave and have a moment. I need to show me some self-love.&quot;

Well, she&#39;s a bee and probably only has a &quot;moment&quot; to live, but you keep that to yourself. Instead you say &quot;Good for you! Go out there and get you some self-love, girl.&quot;

&quot;Thank you. I will now give you your reward for helping me out. Instead of the certain death that I would have subjected you to should you have told, I will give you this-&quot;
She pulls a strange bottled electric blue substance out of one of her cubbies. She uncorks the bottle and hocks a big ol&#39; lugee into the goo, which causes the mystery sludge to turn from blue to a radioactive purple. It starts to pulse with a light and a funky smell taints the air.

She hands you the bottle &quot;Drink up, honey, but not until we get out of the hive.&quot;

You take the bottle. &quot;Wait, &#39;we?&#39;&quot;

To answer, she simply grabs her little purse, and your hand, and speeds the two of you out of the hive in the hutch.

&quot;Now, drink all of that mixture.&quot;

You do as she says. &quot;Good. You&#39;ll be back to your old self in no time!&quot;

Before any of your millions of questions can spill their way out you feel a strange tug in your gut, and then-


!!SHAZAM!!
*lightning*
!!!P O O F!!!

You&#39;re human again.
You live the rest of your life in a state of madness still bee-lieving that you&#39;re a bee.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="Ask him about the sludge" tags="" position="301,600" size="100,100">&quot;What&#39;s the deal with this blue sludge?&quot; you inquire.

&quot;Yo, I don&#39;t know what that stuff is, but it smells weird and it ain&#39;t right. I&#39;d steer clear of it if I were you. If you want to know more about it, I would ask this one old timer who was working near one of the hive entrances during The Occurrance. He could know a thing or two considering the poor guy lost all but one leg to the stuff.&quot;

&quot;So how do I get to this guy?&quot;

&quot;Go down this passage and take every right you can. If you get to a dead end, back track to your last turn and then go to your [[right]] from there. You&#39;ll find yourself in the right place. Old timer should be buzzin&#39; around there somewhere.&quot;

You thank him, wish him luck in fiding a better life outside of the hive, and go on your journey into the hive to find this &quot;old timer.&quot;

!!!P O O F!!!

You sit bolt-upright in bed, drenched in sweat.
You look around.

This is your room.
That&#39;s your wife still sound asleep next to you.
You get up and look in the mirror.
No wings. Normal sized. It was all a dream?

What a vivid dream!

You go to your window and look outside at your little beekeeping hutch bathed in moonlight.

Yeah, maybe beekeeping isn&#39;t for you, afterall. You&#39;re better off raising chickens or something.

Yucky.

You decide to buzz around and start up conversations with some of the worker bees you asked about the blue stuff. They were all some pretty interesting fellas.
That one bee who was trying to get away has it all wrong. This place isn&#39;t so bad. Staying here would be nice, plus it would be cool research for what it&#39;s like to actually live in a hive.

You decide to make yourself at home within this hive. You live a humble life as a simple worker bee for the rest of your days.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="Magic coat" tags="" position="1293,601" size="200,100">You pick the coat, which is the same pattern as a bee&#39;s exoskeleton.

You put it on and immediately feel funny.

*Z I P*
*P O P!!*

You&#39;ve made a full transformation into a bee! You live the rest of your life as the Captain of the Queen&#39;s Royal Guard. Un-BEE-lievable!!!

&quot;Drink all of that up, my sweet hero!&quot; coos the queen, &quot;I will always be greatful to you.&quot;

You toss it back as best you can. As you swallow the last drop, you hear the queen sigh &quot;Farewell.&quot; 

You have just enough time to look at her, perplexed, before-
